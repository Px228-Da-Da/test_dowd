//! The application: state, startup, and the per-frame update loop.
//!
//! [`App`] holds every piece of runtime state and implements [`eframe::App`].
//! The work is split across child modules so this file stays focused on the
//! struct definition and the high-level frame orchestration in [`App::update`]:
//!
//! * [`library`]  — likes, playlist membership, deletion, drag-and-drop import.
//! * [`playback`] — what plays next, transport actions, the playback queue.
//! * [`input`]    — keyboard handling and global media hotkeys.
//! * [`ui`]       — every panel, modal and overlay that gets drawn.
//!
//! ## Key model notes
//! * Playback uses a *snapshot* queue ([`App::playback_queue`]) captured when a
//!   track starts, so switching pages mid-song never changes "what plays next".
//! * The "Liked music" playlist is a normal [`Playlist`] whose name equals
//!   [`LIKED_PLAYLIST_NAME`]. In the sidebar it is shown via a dedicated button
//!   and addressed by the sentinel index [`LIKED_PAGE_IDX`] rather than a real
//!   list position.
